![SubP](https://github.com/SecWithMoh/SubP/blob/main/sc.PNG)
## Overview

Welcome to **Subfinder JSON Parser to SQLite**, a Go-based tool specifically designed to process JSON output from the popular subdomain discovery tool, [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder). This tool parses the JSON results generated by Subfinder and stores them in an SQLite database for easy querying and analysis.

## Features

- 🗂️ **Bulk JSON Processing**: Efficiently process entire directories of JSON files produced by Subfinder.
- 🗃️ **Dynamic Table Creation**: Automatically creates and manages database tables based on input types, tailored to Subfinder's JSON structure.
- 🔍 **Record Deduplication**: Automatically checks for and prevents the insertion of duplicate records.
- 🔄 **Subdomain List Conversion**: Convert plain text subdomain lists into JSON format compatible with Subfinder's output and process them seamlessly.
- ⚙️ **Extensible Design**: Easily modifiable codebase, allowing future enhancements and additional features.

## Planned Features

- 🚀 **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Tools for generating visual reports from the stored data.
- 🔗 **Integration with Other Recon Tools**: Seamless integration with other popular reconnaissance tools.
- 🔧 **Advanced Filtering Options**: Ability to filter and query specific subdomains based on various criteria.
- 📊 **Exporting Capabilities**: Options to export data in multiple formats, including CSV and JSON.

## Installation

To install the tool, ensure you have Go installed, then run:

```bash
go get -u github.com/secwithmoh/SubP
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the tool:

```bash
SubP -i /path/to/json/dir -o /path/to/output/dir -db mydatabase.db
```

### Command-Line Options

- `-i`, `--input`: Directory containing JSON files generated by Subfinder (required)
- `-o`, `--output`: Directory to save the SQLite DB file (required)
- `-db`, `--dbname`: SQLite DB file name (default: `data.db`)
- `-tb`, `--tablename`: Optional: Specify the table name to append data
- `-jsfile`, `--jsonfilename`: Optional: Specify a specific Subfinder JSON file to process
- `-l`, `--subdomainlist`: Optional: Provide a file with a list of subdomains to convert to JSON and process
- `-ind`, `--inputdomain`: Input domain to be used in the generated JSON (required with `--subdomainlist`)
- `-h`, `--help`: Show help menu

### Sample Usage

#### Processing a Directory of Subfinder JSON Files

```bash
SubP -i ./json_files -o ./output -db subdomains.db
```

#### Converting a Subdomain List and Processing

```bash
SubP -i ./json_files -o ./output -db subdomains.db -l subdomains.txt -ind example.com
```

This command converts `subdomains.txt` to JSON, then processes and inserts the data into `subdomains.db`.
